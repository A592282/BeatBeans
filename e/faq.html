        <h3>Hiring</h3>
        <h4>If you're comfortable working independetly, solving the most complex problems as well as the most mundane, and want to join a very tiny company with plans to be a very valuable company, we'd like to see your work and get to know you better.</h4>
        <h4>The specific positions here are what we know we need soon. But we are sorry we dont have any specific positions now. But it's entirely possible we need you, even if we don't know it yet.</h4> <h4>If so, submit a cover letter and resume for the <span> "other" </span>position @ <span> "vibrantcolors@beatbeans.com" </span>.</h4>
        <br/>
        <h3>Common factors for all position</h3>
        <h5><img src="img/arrow.png" /> When people ask us where we're based, we typically respond <span>"on the internet"</span> that is, although our current office is in Bangalore-India, we're looking for talented people wherever they might be based.</h5>
        
        <h5><img src="img/arrow.png" /> You're excited to help create not only the architecture of our products. but the culture of the company. You lead by example.</h5>
        <h5><img src="img/arrow.png" /> You don't need much direction, but when you do, you're comfortable asking for it. </h5>
        <h5><img src="img/arrow.png" /> You're willing to dive into just about any problem, even if it's outside your area of expertise. You cheerfully accept responsibilty for whatever needs to get done, but relinguish it when that makes more sense.</h5>
        <h5><img src="img/arrow.png" /> When you attack a task, you stay on it until it's done. And though you can crack out tons of work, you know when you've done enough(not everything has to be perfect but some things do.</h5>
        <h5><img src="img/arrow.png" /> You can deal with uncertainty and change. During severe course correction you stay on an even keel. You're a pleasure to be around when things get tough.</h5>
        <h5><img src="img/arrow.png" /> You keep up to date with the latest developments, but you're immune to fads and technology/business religion. You just choose the right tools for the job at hand.</h5>
      
	<h3>NOTE:</h3>
	<h4>We do not consider your <span>Religion, Caste, Skin color, Ethnicity, Nationality (If legally approved), Gender, Fathers Occupation, Family income, Physical Disabilities (If it don't effect the work done).</span> Language spoken at home etc while hiring. We are least bothered about it. So please don't mention anything like that in the resume. If you are good at technology you are in AS SIMPLE AS THAT :)</h4>
